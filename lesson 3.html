<h2>part 1</h2>
<p>
    The book is set in 1984 in Oceania, one of three perpetually warring totalitarian states (the other two are Eurasia and Eastasia).<br>
    Oceania is governed by the all-controlling Party, which has brainwashed the population into unthinking obedience to its leader, Big Brother. <br>
    The Party has created a propagandistic language known as Newspeak, which is designed to limit free thought and promote the Party’s doctrines.<br>
    Its words include doublethink (belief in contradictory ideas simultaneously), which is reflected in the Party’s slogans: “War is peace,” “Freedom is slavery,” and “Ignorance is strength.” <br>
    The Party maintains control through the Thought Police and continual surveillance.

<h2 id="p0">Part 2</h2>
<p>
    The book’s hero, Winston Smith, is a minor party functionary living in a London that is still shattered by a nuclear war that took place not long after World War II. He belongs to the Outer Party, and his job is to rewrite history in the Ministry of Truth, bringing it in line with current political thinking.</br>
    However, Winston’s longing for truth and decency leads him to secretly rebel against the government.<br>
    He embarks on a forbidden affair with Julia, a like-minded woman, and they rent a room in a neighbourhood populated by Proles (short for proletariats).<br>
        Winston also becomes increasingly interested in the Brotherhood, a group of dissenters. <br>
</p>
   <p class="p4 ">
       Unbeknownst to Winston and Julia, however, they are being watched closely (ubiquitous posters throughout the city warn residents that “Big Brother is watching you.”).
       When Winston is approached by O’Brien—an official of the Inner Party who appears to be a secret member of the Brotherhood—the trap is set.<br>
   </p>
<h3>part 3</h3>
    <p>
        O’Brien is actually a spy for the Party, on the lookout for “thought-criminals,” and Winston and Julia are eventually caught and sent to the Ministry of Love for a violent reeducation.<br>
    The ensuing imprisonment, torture, and reeducation of Winston are intended not merely to break him physically or make him submit but to root out his independence and destroy his dignity and humanity. <br>
    In Room 101, where prisoners are forced into submission by exposure to their worst nightmares, Winston panics as a cage of rats is attached to his head. He yells out for his tormentors to “Do it to Julia!” and states that he does not care what happens to her.<br>
        With this betrayal, Winston is released. <br>
    </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p class="p4">
       He later encounters Julia, and neither is interested in the other. Instead, Winston loves Big Brother.
